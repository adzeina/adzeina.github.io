                        What is a Cookie? A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on
                        your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or
                        preferences over time. Most Internet browsers support cookies; however, users can set their
                        browsers to decline certain types of cookies or specific cookies. Further, users can delete
                        cookies at any time.

                        with the more relevant information. Additionally, cookies allow us to serve you specific
                        content, such as videos on our website(s). We may employ the learnings of your behaviour on our
                        website(s) to serve you with targeted advertisements on third-party website(s) in an effort to
                        “re-market” our products and services to you.

                        How are cookies used for advertising purposes? Cookies and ad technology such as web beacons,
                        pixels, and anonymous ad network tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They
                        also help us collect aggregated audit data, research, and performance reporting for advertisers.
                        Pixels enable us to understand and improve the delivery of ads to you, and know when certain ads
                        have been shown to you. Since your web browser may request advertisements and web beacons
                        directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just
                        as if you had requested a web page from their site. Although we do not use cookies to create a
                        profile of your browsing behavior on third-party sites, we do use aggregate data from third
                        parties to show you relevant, interest-based advertising. We do not provide any personal
                        information that we collect to advertisers. You can opt out of off-site and third-party-informed
                        advertising by adjusting your cookie settings. Opting out will not remove advertising from the
                        pages you visit, but, instead, opting out will result in the ads you see not being matched to

                        How are third party cookies used? For sous of the functions within our websites we use third
                        party suppliers, for example, when you visit a page with videos embedded from or links to
                        YouTube. These videos or links (and any other content from third party suppliers) may contain
                        third party cookies, and we encourage you to consult the privacy policies of these third party
                        vendors on their websites for information regarding their use of cookies.
